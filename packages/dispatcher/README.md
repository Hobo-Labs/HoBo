# @hobo/dispatcher

The Dispatcher (ADR-0071): deterministic, credit/budget-aware selection across
registered providers for placement (`match.Decided`), dispatch
(`dispatch.Decided`), and traffic (`traffic-backend` category — consumed by the
stations routing control loop).

- Ranks candidates by effective marginal cost against a pinned
  `CreditLedgerView@seq` (free tiers, rate/concurrency headroom, budget caps,
  switching cost, soonest-expiring credits).
- Hysteresis holds an incumbent unless savings clear a recorded threshold —
  never when the incumbent violates a budget hard constraint.
- Reservation ledger with CAS (`expectedSeq`) so concurrent dispatches cannot
  double-spend free headroom; reserve/confirm/release/expire emit
  `dispatch.Reservation*` facts.
- `replayDispatchDecision` replays identical inputs to a byte-identical
  decision fact.
- **`decideDispatchV2`** (schema `hobo.dispatcher/v2`) ranks registered providers
  by minimum incremental **billed** amount from `@hobo/pricing` quotes; v1
  `decideDispatch` is unchanged for credit ranking.

## Dispatcher v2

`decideDispatchV2` and `@hobo/dispatcher/v2` use schema
`hobo.dispatcher/v2`. For each candidate's `QuoteScenario`, the adapter calls
`@hobo/pricing` and ranks exact `incremental.billed` decimals under the
`min-incremental-billed` objective. Provider ID breaks equal-cost ties.
Rejected, stale, partial, unpriced, or cross-currency quotes fail closed and
never fall back to list price. `DispatchCostQuote` omits the advisory
`allocatedEffective` field. V1 source and replay behavior remain untouched; a
fixed-fixture SHA-256 golden pins the complete v1 decision. The
`@hobo/dispatcher -> @hobo/pricing` dependency is a registered conformance edge;
v2 does not import v1 ranking internals or CI.

See [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for evidence and
[`contracts/`](./contracts) for the v1 and v2 PACT boundaries.
