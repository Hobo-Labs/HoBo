/**
 * Prisma Postgres's redactor is the shared one (`@hobo/provider-redaction`) plus its
 * own shapes, with the text percent-decoded fully first. Before the move it
 * had its own copy, which decoded by running over the whole text again until
 * it stopped changing — one pass per layer of `%25`, so a megabyte of nested
 * encoding was quadratic — and whose private-key shape searched from every
 * BEGIN for an END. These pin that nothing it redacted leaks now, encoded or
 * not, and that it is linear.
 *
 * This is the fast tier: `shared-redaction.deep.test.ts` holds the sweeps, the
 * growth measurements and the full-size differential (`pnpm run test:deep`).
