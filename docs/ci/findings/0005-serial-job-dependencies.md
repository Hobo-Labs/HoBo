# Finding 5: serial job dependencies

`artifact-trust` and `dev-cold-loop-gate` had `needs: pr-gate`, so they waited for the slowest PR job and then
for a slot. Neither consumes anything from `pr-gate`. `ci-runner-image` and `secret-scan` checked out the
ts-autocode submodule without using it.

Fixes: [#1640](https://github.com/Hobo-Labs/HoBo/pull/1640). On its own run, the cold loop finished before
the CI fabric contract guard had even started.
